## üîß How to Add Questions

You can easily add your own questions to the quiz by editing the `questions.json` file.

1. Open the `questions.json` file in a text editor.
2. Inside the main `[]` brackets, you will see a list of question "objects," each enclosed in `{}` curly braces and separated by commas.
3. To add a new question, copy an existing question object, paste it after the last one, and make sure to add a comma after the preceding object.
4. Modify the values for each key in your new question object.

### Question Object Explained

Here is a breakdown of each key in a question object:

```json
{
  "question": "Which Google Cloud service is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse?",
  "answers": [
    "Cloud SQL",
    "Bigtable",
    "BigQuery",
    "Datastore"
  ],
  "correct": 2,
  "explanation": "BigQuery is Google Cloud's serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective cloud data warehouse.",
  "verified": true
}
````

* `"question"`: (String) The text of the question you want to ask.
* `"answers"`: (Array of Strings) A list of possible answers. You should provide four options.
* `"correct"`: (Number) The index of the correct answer in the `"answers"` array. **This is zero-based**, meaning the first answer is `0`, the second is `1`, the third is `2`, and the fourth is `3`. In the example above, `2` points to `"BigQuery"` as the correct answer.
* `"explanation"`: (String) A detailed explanation of why the correct answer is right. This will be shown to the user if they answer incorrectly.
* `"verified"`: (Boolean) Set this to `true` if the question and its explanation have been reviewed for accuracy. This will display the "Verified" icon (‚úÖ). If you set it to `false` or omit the key entirely, the "Not Verified" icon (üõ°Ô∏è) will be shown.
